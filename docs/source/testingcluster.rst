=================================
Testing the Cluster
=================================
.. _`Testing Galera Cluster`:

When you have your cluster up and running, you may want to test certain features to ensure that they are working properly or to prepare yourself for actual problems that may arise.

-------------------------------------------
Replication Testing
-------------------------------------------
.. _`Replication Testing`:

To test that Galera Cluster is working as expected, complete the following steps:

1. On the database client, verify that all nodes have connected to each other:

   .. code-block:: mysql

	SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_%';

	 +---------------------------+------------+
	 | Variable_name             | Value      |
	 +---------------------------+------------+
	 ...
	 | wsrep_local_state_comment | Synced (6) |
	 | wsrep_cluster_size        | 3          |
	 | wsrep_ready               | ON         |
	 +---------------------------+------------+

  - ``wsrep_local_state_comment``: The value ``Synced`` indicates that the node is connected to the cluster and operational.

  - ``wsrep_cluster_size``: The value indicates the nodes in the cluster.

  - ``wsrep_ready``: The value ``ON`` indicates that this node is connected to the cluster and able to handle transactions.

2. On the database client of node1, create a table and insert data:

   .. code-block:: mysql

	CREATE DATABASE galeratest;
	USE galeratest;
	CREATE TABLE test 
		(id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
		msg TEST);
	INSERT INTO test (msg)
		VALUES ("Hello my dear cluster.");
	INSERT INTO test (msg)
		VALUES ("Hello, again, cluster dear.");

3. On the database client of node2, check that the data was replicated correctly:

   .. code-block:: mysql

	USE galeratest;
	SELECT * FROM test;

	 +----+-----------------------------+
	 | id | msg                         |
	 +----+-----------------------------+
	 |  1 | Hello my dear cluster.      |
	 |  2 | Hello, again, cluster dear. |
	 +----+-----------------------------+

The results given in the ``SELECT`` query indicates that data you entered in node1 has replicated into node2.


-------------------------------------------
Split-brain Testing
-------------------------------------------
.. _`Split Brain Testing`:

To test Galera Cluster for split-brain situations on a two node cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Disconnect the network connection between the two cluster nodes.  

   The quorum is lost and the nodes do not serve requests.

2. Reconnect the network connection.

   The quorum remains lost, and the nodes do not serve requests.

3. On one of the database clients, reset the quorum:

   .. code-block:: mysql

	SET GLOBAL wsrep_provider_options='pc.bootstrap=1';

The quorum is reset and the cluster recovered.


--------------------
 Failure Simulation
--------------------
.. _`Failure Simulation`:

You can also test *Galera Cluster* by simulating various failure situations on three nodes as follows:

- To simulate a crash of a single ``mysqld`` process, run the command below on one of the nodes:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ killall -9 mysqld

- To simulate a network disconnection, use ``iptables`` or ``netem`` to block all TCP/IP traffic to a node.
- To simulate an entire server crash, run each ``mysqld`` in a virtualized guest, and abrubtly terminate the entire virtual instance.

If you have three or more Galera Cluster nodes, the cluster should be able to survive the simulations.
