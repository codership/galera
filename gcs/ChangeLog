2010-07-18 Alex 
    Substituted gcs_slave_queue_len() with gcs_get_stats() to return
    a wider range of gcs performance statistics. At this time it includes
    average slave queue length, average send queue length, fraction of
    time spent paused and number of flow control events sent and received.

2010-06-16 Alex 
    Added gcs_interrupt() call to be able to interrupt scheduled threads.
    Version 0.13.1

2010-05-31 Alex 
    Added flow control monitor and ability to synchronize with gcs_send()
    and gcs_repl() calls thus guaranteeing FIFO order. Version 0.13.0

2010-05-20 Alex 
    Added gcs_slave_queue_len() query to API.

2009-11-21 Alex 
    Extended state message to contain previous primary configuraiton info.
    Many bugfixes and cleanups. Version 0.12.0

2009-08-09 Alex 
    Added possibility to specify desired donor. Version 0.11.0

2009-08-06 Alex 
    Refactored interface. Now connection URL is supplied to gcs_open() and
    not gcs_create(). It is done to satisfy wsrep API changes and is generally
    cleaner as it separates library initialisation from connection
    establishment. Version: 0.10.0

2009-07-21 Alex 
    Added node name and incoming address arguments to gcs_create(). Thus
    it should be possible to give nodes sensible names and see them in logs.
    Version: 0.9.0

2009-06-21 Alex 
    Moved TO module out of the library. Since it no longer offers this
    interface, bumped minor version: 0.8.0

2008-11-16 Alex 
    Many bugfixes. 
    Fixed handling of self-leave meassages.
    Switched to "mallocless" FIFO implementaiton in gu_fifo.c
    Resolved apparent race condition and optimized FC message sending.
    Package version 0.7.2

2008-11-09 Alex 
    Changed state transfer protocol to require join message to be sent by
    both parties involved in state transfer. Package version 0.7.1, library
    interface 9.0.0.

2008-10-21 Alex 
    First implementation of state transfer request protocol. Bumped package
    version to 0.7.0, library interface to 8.0.0.

2008-09-29 Alex (postfactum)
    State exchange (GCS state exchange, not application state exchange)
    implemented. Now we have some sort of quourum calculations and global-scope
    sequence numbers. New nodes can join without having to restart the whole
    group. Bumped package version to 0.6.0.

2008-08-01 Alex (postfactum)
    START/STOP-based flow control. A little bit ahead of the plan.

2008-07-30 Alex 
    Added gcs_join() and gcs_wait() getting closer to final API.
    gcs_join() moves connection to JOINED state.
    gcs_wait() blocks waiting for the group memebers to catch up.

2008-05-14 Alex 
    Added gcs_create() and gcs_destroy() for safe and clean initialization and
    deinitialization of GCS connection handle.

2008-03-23 Alex 
    Added gcs_set_last_applied() and gcs_get_last_applied() - calls for voting
    for the last applied action.
