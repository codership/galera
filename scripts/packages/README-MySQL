ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

This document briefly explains how to use Galera wsrep provider with MySQL
RDBMS. For more information check http://www.codership.com/wiki/doku.php


                     Using MySQL with GALERA v2.x

1. WHAT IS MYSQL/GALERA CLUSTER

MySQL/Galera cluster is a synchronous multi-master cluster solution for InnoDB
engine based on wsrep API (https://github.com/codership/wsrep-API) which Galera is
implementation of. It requires MySQL server patched to use this API
(https://launchpad.net/codership-mysql).

Node states are synchronized by replicating transaction changes at commit time.
The cluster is virtually synchronous: this means that each node commits
transactions in exactly the same order, although not necessarily at the same
physical moment. (The latter is not that important as it may seem, since in most
cases DBMS gives no guarantee on when the transaction is actually processed.)
Built-in flow control keeps nodes within fraction of a second from each other,
this is more than enough for most practical purposes.

From the client perspective that means:

 * Truly highly available: no committed transaction is ever lost in case of
   a node crash.

 * Highly transparent: with few exceptions each node can be treated as a normal
   standalone MySQL/InnoDB server.

 * True multi-master: all cluster nodes can modify the same table concurrently.

 * Scalable even with WRITE-intensive applications.


2. MYSQL/GALERA NODE SETUP

To setup MySQL/Galera node you will need to

1) Install wsrep-patched MySQL from https://launchpad.net/codership-mysql/0.7.
   Please see the documentation that comes with it about first time node setup.

2) Configure it to use Galera library as a wsrep provider. For that set
   wsrep_provider option to
   wsrep_provider=/usr/lib/galera/libgalera_smm.so   (DEB systems) or
   wsrep_provider=/usr/lib64/galera/libgalera_smm.so (RPM systems).

3) Start MySQL server.


3. CONNECTING TO CLUSTER

To join the cluster you will need to set global wsrep_cluster_address variable
either in wsrep.cnf file or from the command line (the latter is recommended to
avoid automatic connection to failed nodes). E.g.

mysql> SET GLOBAL wsrep_cluster_address='gcomm://';

to bootstrap a new cluster, or

mysql> SET GLOBAL wsrep_cluster_address='gcomm://<another node address>:4567';

to join existing cluster. Upon connecting to initial node, the server will
obtain the list of other nodes and connect to each of them.

There is a number of options that can be passed to Galera with the
wsrep_cluster_address string. See README for details.

After connecting to cluster the new node will synchronize its state by receiving
state snapshot form one of the peers. For the duration of this procedure both
nodes may be unable to process client requests. Other nodes are unaffected by
this.


4. SETTING GALERA PARAMETERS IN MYSQL

To configure Galera parameteres set wsrep_provider_options variable either
in my.cnf or in the command line:

   wsrep_provider_options="gcs.fc_limit = 128; gcs.fc_master_slave = yes"

Certain parameteres can be changed in runtime:

   mysql> SET GLOBAL wsrep_provider_options="evs.send_window=16";

will only change the value of evs.send_window parameter. For the list of all
Galera parameters see main README and http://www.codership.com/wiki.

   mysql> SHOW VARIABLES like 'wsrep_provider_options';

Will show all parameters and their current values.


5. LIMITATIONS

1) Currently replication works only with InnoDB storage engine. Any writes to 
   tables of other types, including system (mysql.*) tables are not replicated. 
   However, DDL statements are replicated in statement level, and changes
   to mysql.* tables will get replicated that way. 
   So, you can safely issue: CREATE USER..., 
   but issuing: INSERT INTO mysql.user..., will not be replicated.

2) DELETE operation is unsupported on tables without primary keys.
   Rows in tables without primary keys may appear in different order on
   different nodes. As a result SELECT...LIMIT... may return slightly
   different sets.

3) Unsupported queries:
    * LOCK/UNLOCK tables is not supported in multimaster configuration.
    * lock functions (GET_LOCK(), RELEASE_LOCK()... )

4) Query log cannot be directed to table. If you enable query logging,
   you must forward the log to a file:
       log_output = FILE
   Use general_log and general_log_file to choose query logging and the 
   log file name

5) Maximum allowed transaction size is defined by wsrep_max_ws_rows and
   wsrep_max_ws_size. Anything bigger (e.g. huge LOAD DATA) will be rejected.

6) Due to cluster level optimistic concurrency control, transaction issuing
   COMMIT may still be aborted at that stage. There can be two transactions 
   writing to same rows and committing in separate cluster nodes, and only one
   of the them can successfully commit. The failing one will be aborted.
   For cluster level aborts, MySQL/galera cluster gives back deadlock error 
   code (Error: 1213 SQLSTATE: 40001  (ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK)).

7) XA transactions can not be supported due to possible rollback on commit.
